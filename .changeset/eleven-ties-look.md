## Minor changes

The ability to load an external configuration file depended on the [proload](https://github.com/natemoo-re/proload) package.
The updated Astro removed the **proload** dependency from its core. Therefore, this option is no more available for the integration.

chore: deps update
fix: update compilation target for Node 16
